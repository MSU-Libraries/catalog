[AdditionalHeaders]
; Due to the nature of EDS API integrations EBSCO's web application firewall (WAF) does not have sufficient

; This is important to guarantee accurate COUNTER 5 usage reports. The Counter Code of Practice 5.1 stipulates:
; "Activity generated by internet robots and crawlers MUST be excluded from all COUNTER usage reports."
; See https://cop5.countermetrics.org/en/5.1/07-processing/08-internet-robots-and-crawlers.html

; If you are already protecting your site from bots, e.g. through your own WAF, you might not wish to enable this
