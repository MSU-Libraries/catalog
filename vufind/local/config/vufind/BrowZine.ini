default_view         = list

; This controls whether results are loaded with JavaScript when paging or changing

; enabled by default. Loading will automatically fall back to non-JS mode if
; JavaScript is not supported by the browser.

; This setting can be used to configure pagination control on top of results.
; Possible options are:
; empty string or false  No top pagination (default)
; simple                 Simple next/prev button pagination

; This section contains settings related to the BrowZine cover image loader.
[Covers]
; Any URLs in this list will be ignored when using the BrowZine cover image; this
; allows "no match" images to be skipped so that other cover providers can fill in
; BrowZine's gaps. If this setting is omitted, the default value below will be used.
; If you want to disable skipping of generic images, set the value to an empty string.

; This section controls the behavior of the BrowZine identifier link handler; see also
; the [IdentifierLinks] section of config.ini to activate the handler.
[IdentifierLinks]
; Can be set to "include" to include only the options listed in the "filter"
; setting, or to "exclude" to filter out the options listed in the "filter"
; setting. The default is "none," which performs no filtering.
;filterType = exclude
; This repeatable section can be used to filter based on link type; legal
; options are the keys defined in DOIServices and ISSNServices sections.

; versions. You can get the same results by changing the DOIServices and/or
; ISSNServices sections.

; When this setting is enabled, the BrowZine-supplied "recommendedLinkText" label will be
; used for each given "best" link, and the label defined below is ignored. Default is false.
; This applies only to the "bestIntegratorLink" service where recommended text is supplied.
; Note that Third Iron may change this text over time, and VuFind will attempt localization,
; but its current strings are not currently defined in the /languages files.
;useBrowzineLabel = true

; This setting controls icons displayed with links. If set to false, icons are loaded
; from Third Iron's assets. If true, icons defined in the DOIServices section are
